# Docker

## Why Docker
``Docker`` is the default way to build and run containers. In ``Proxmox`` we have ``LXC`` but what I do is to run a docker container inside a LXC container. Why? Because ``Docker`` is what it is used nowadays and it's important to know all the secrets of it.

## Selfhosted
Here is all my ``docker-compose`` files and its config so you can use them. It also serves me as a ``backup`` :)
