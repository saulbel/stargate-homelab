# stargate-homelab

## Prerequisites
Things you need before starting:
* `Some spare hardware`
* `Time and will to have fun :)`

## Project structure
```
stargate-homelab
└── automation
    └── ansible    
    └── argocd  
    └── terraform
└── docker   
└── observability
    └── prometheus  
└── proxmox
└── tailscale
```

## Tasks to accomplish
- The idea of this project is to build a homelab using `proxmox` where we can have tools for daily use and to test things for work or just for fun.

## 2) [Observability](./observability/prometheus/README.md)

## Next steps
- I will document everything so you can mirror it.
- I will continue to add all the improvements.
