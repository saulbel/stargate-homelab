# 🚦 ArgoCD

ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.  
It keeps your cluster state in sync with your Git repositories, automating deployments and lifecycle management.

---

## 🚀 Why ArgoCD?

- **GitOps:** Manage your Kubernetes apps using Git as the source of truth.
- **Declarative:** Define desired state with YAML manifests or Helm charts.
- **Automated sync:** Automatically applies changes from your repo to your cluster.
- **Visual dashboard:** Web UI for monitoring and managing deployments.
- **Rollback:** Easily revert to previous versions.

## 🚦 App of Apps Pattern

ArgoCD supports the **App of Apps** pattern, which allows you to manage multiple applications through a single parent application.  
This parent app (often called "bootstrap") references other ArgoCD Application manifests, enabling you to declaratively bootstrap your entire cluster from one place.

**Benefits:**
- Centralized management of all apps
- Easy onboarding and scaling of new services
- Consistent GitOps workflows

In this repo, [bootstrap](/kubernetes/argocd/clusters/bootstrap) is the parent directory that syncs all core and addon applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

After K3s is set up, the following script is executed by Terraform to install ArgoCD and bootstrap your apps:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

echo "Ensuring external-secrets namespace exists..."
if ! kubectl get namespace external-secrets >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  kubectl create namespace external-secrets
  echo "Created external-secrets namespace."
else
  echo "external-secrets namespace already exists. Skipping creation."
fi

echo "Applying Infisical credentials secret..."
kubectl apply -f /home/saul/k3s/infisical/secret.yaml

echo "Installing ArgoCD..."
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install argocd argo/argo-cd \
  --namespace argocd \
  --create-namespace \
  --values /home/saul/k3s/argocd/config.yaml

echo "Adding Git SSH secret..."
kubectl apply -f /home/saul/k3s/argocd/argocd-repo-secret.yaml

echo "Bootstrapping ArgoCD apps..."
kubectl apply -f /home/saul/k3s/argocd/bootstrap.yaml
```

This script is called in `main.tf` after K3s setup:

```hcl
# install argocd and apps
provisioner "local-exec" {
    working_dir = "/home/saul/k3s"
    command = "./install.sh"
}
```
